	<p>Welcome to Roomsurfer! This page is meant to be used by University of Waterloo students when they are in need of a room
	to study in. Click "Find times" to find out when a particular room is free, or click "Find rooms" to find out what 
	rooms are free at a specific time. The current term is Winter 2014 (1141).</p> 

	<p>PLEASE NOTE: These times do not include private bookings, i.e. if the room has been booked by a school club, then it will 
	not appear here. This will only be able to display when a particular room does not have a class in it. Perhaps one day I 
	will be able to handle private bookings.</p>
	<ul class="nav">

	<h3>Find free times</h3>
	<p>Enter a room to check when it's free. You should note that the latest a class can 
		run is 9:50 PM, so if a room is free until then, it will be free afterwards too.
